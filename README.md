# JASM -- (J)ust an (AS)se(M)bly 

JASM is a bytecode assembly backend for creating scripting languages that will compile to JABL (Just a Byte Language). The
purpose of this project is to create a backend for easily creating scripting languages that'll be embedded into C++ code,
or will be used as a regular lanugage. With this way, anyone that wants to create a scripting language will be 
free of performance and execution based headaches, thus being able to focus on their language desing and leave the rest
to JASM and JABL. In addition, the future plans for this project includes adding support for converting JASM and JABL to
real assembly languages. Maybe a utopic plan for now, but who knows?

> Note: JASM is just a part of JAVM (Just A Virtual Machine) project and JAVM is still in progress, so don't let questions
like "What am I going to do with a bytecode when I can't execute it?"

## Quickstart

### Installation

You can either grab the compiled binaries from the release section, or build JASM from source.

## Contributing

Since I don't really have **any** kind of experience in open source and development in general, I'll probably be satisfied
with the state of JASM and move on. That doesn't mean I won't maintain it but new features might not be implemented quickly
as the time passes. So every inch of help is much greatly appreciated, just don't forget to add your name to CONTRIBUTORS.md
and also don't forget to update necessary documents in the repository when you add/remove a dependency/feature/bug. If you
are new around here like me, take a look at --Contributing.md link here--!
