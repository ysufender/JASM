# JASM -- (J)ust an (AS)se(M)bly 

JASM is a bytecode assembly backend for creating scripting languages that will compile to JABL (Just a Byte Language). The
purpose of this project is to create a backend for easily creating scripting languages that'll be embedded into C++ code,
or will be used as a regular lanugage. With this way, anyone that wants to create a scripting language will be 
free of performance and execution based headaches, thus being able to focus on their language desing and leave the rest
to JASM and JABL. In addition, the future plans for this project includes adding support for converting JASM and JABL to
real assembly languages. Maybe a utopic plan for now, but who knows?

> Note: JASM is just a part of JAVM (Just A Virtual Machine) project and JAVM is still in progress, so don't let questions
like "What am I going to do with a bytecode when I can't execute it?"

## Quickstart
